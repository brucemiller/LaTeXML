\emph{Now available}:  \htmlref{\LaTeXML\ \CurrentVersion}{get}!

In the process of developing the
\href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{Digital Library of Mathematical Functions},
we needed a means of transforming
the \LaTeX\ sources of our material into XML which would be used
for further manipulations, rearrangements and construction of the web site.
In particular, a true `Digital Library' should focus on the \emph{semantics}
of the material, and so we should convert the mathematical material into both
content and presentation MathML.
At the time, we found no software suitable to our needs, so we began
development of \LaTeXML\ in-house.  

In brief, \texttt{latexml} is a program, written in Perl, that attempts to
faithfully mimic \TeX's behavior, but produces XML instead of dvi.
The document model of the target XML makes explicit the model implied
by \LaTeX.
The processing and model are both extensible; you can define
the mapping between \TeX\ constructs and the XML fragments to be created.
A postprocessor, \texttt{latexmlpost} converts this
XML into other formats such as HTML or XHTML, with options
to convert the math into MathML (currently only presentation) or images.

\emph{Caveats}: It isn't finished, there are gaps in the coverage,
particularly in missing implementations of the many useful \LaTeX\ packages.
But is beginning to stabilize and interested parties
are invited to try it out, give feedback and even to help out.


%============================================================
\section{Examples}\label{examples}\index{examples}
At the moment, the best example of \LaTeXML's output is 
the \href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{DLMF} itself.
There is, of course, a fair amount of insider, special case,
code, but it shows what can be done.

Some highlights:
\begin{description}
\item[\href{examples/tabular/tabular.html}{LaTeX tabular}]
    from the \LaTeX\ manual, p.205.
    (\href{examples/tabular/tabular.tex}{\TeX},
     \href{examples/tabular/tabular.pdf}{\PDFIcon})
\item[\url{http://latexml.mathweb.org/editor}] an online editor/showcase
  of things that \LaTeXML\ can do.
\item[\url{http://arxmliv.kwarc.info}] An experiment processing
  the entire \url{http://arXiv.org}.
\end{description}
And, of course
\begin{description}
\item[\href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{DLMF}]
   The Digital Library of Mathematical Functions was the
   primary instigator for this project.
\item[\href{manual/}{\LaTeXML\ Manual}]

\subsection{Quick Start}\label{get.quick}
\subsubsection{Current Release}\label{get.current}
The current release is \textbf{\CurrentVersion}. (see the \href{Changes}{Change Log}).
\emph{Prebuilt packages sometimes lag behind the latest release.}

Most people will want to install a prebuilt release,
and some version of \TeX. Choose the appropriate
Operating system, repository type and context from the table below.
This will install all necessary prerequisites, unless otherwise noted.

\subsubsection[Development version]{Development version or from Source}\label{get.development}
If you want to use the `bleeding edge' development version with the latest patches and improvements,
you may fetch the source from \GitHub.
(The same installation instructions apply if you are using source from a release tarball.)

\paragraph*{Prerequisites}
will need to be \textbf{pre}-installed (including any optional ones);
see \ref{get.prerequisites}.
\paragraph*{Clone}
the development source from github:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
git clone https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML.git
cd LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}
(Keep up-to-date by occasionally running 
\lstinline[style=shell]{git pull} and rebuilding.)

\subparagraph*{Alternatively}
download a zip of the development
\href{https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML/archive/master.zip}{LaTeXML-master.zip}
from github, and unpack:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
unzip LaTeXML-master.zip
cd LaTeXML-master
\end{lstlisting}
\emph{or} download the release \CurrentTarball, and unpack:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
tar zxvf LaTeXML-@\CurrentVersion@.tar.gz
cd LaTeXML-@\CurrentVersion@
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Build}
\LaTeXML\ in its source directory using the standard Perl procedure
(On Windows, use \texttt{dmake} instead of \texttt{make}):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
\end{lstlisting}
The tests should complete without error (some tests may be `skipped').

Append the following options to the \texttt{perl Makefile.PL} command, if desired:
\begin{description}
\item[PREFIX=\textit{perldir}] specifies a nonstandard place to install LaTeXML
\item[TEXMF=\textit{texdidr}] specifies a where to install \LaTeXML's \TeX\ style files.
\end{description}
(See \texttt{perl perlmodinstall} for more details and options.)

\paragraph*{Install} \LaTeXML\ where the OS can find the files
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}
(Alternatively, you can run directly from the build directory, eg.
\texttt{\textit{latexmldir}/blib/script/latexml}.)

\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{get.prerequisites}
\LaTeXML\ requires several Perl modules to do its job.  Most
are automatically installed by the platform-specific installation or CPAN.
However, CPAN will \emph{not} install the required C libraries needed for
\texttt{XML::LibXML}, and \texttt{XML::LibXSLT}.
If \texttt{libxml2} and \texttt{libxslt} are are not already installed,
follow the instructions at \href{http://www.xmlsoft.org}{XMLSoft} to
download and install the most recent versions of \texttt{libxml2} and \texttt{libxslt}.
Note that Strawberry Perl, on Windows, already includes these libraries
(but ActiveState does not).

Note that to install prerequisites, it may be expedient
when a prebuilt package is available to simply install the prebuilt
package and then uninstall it (which generally leaves the prerequisites installed).
Alternatively, we've provided commands below for most systems
to install only the prerequisites.

\paragraph{Optional Prerequisites}
The following packages are \emph{optional} because they are sometimes difficult
to find or install, or in order to allow for minimal installs in unusual
circumstances.  Most users should consider them as required and install
them if at all possible.
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX] Virtually all users of \LaTeXML\ will want to install \TeX.  \LaTeXML\ 
\emph{should} find whatever \TeX-installation you have, and will
use \TeX's style files directly in some cases, providing broader coverage,
particularly for the more complex styles like \texttt{babel} and \texttt{tikz}.
Moreover, if \TeX\ is present when \LaTeXML\ is being installed,
\LaTeXML\ will install a couple of its own style files that can be used
with regular \TeX, or \LaTeX\ runs;
So if you are going to install \TeX, install it first!
See \href{https://www.tug.org}{\TeX\ Users Group} for more options.

Note that \LaTeXML\ will use, for its own purposes, the style files from whatever
\TeX\ system, if any, it finds at runtime.

\item[Image::Magick] provides a handy library of image manipulation routines.
When they are present \LaTeXML\ is able to carry out more image processing,
such as transformations by the \texttt{graphicx} package, and conversion of math to images;
otherwise, some such operations will not be supported.

Please do \emph{not} try to install \texttt{Image::Magick} from CPAN, however:
the module there seldom matches the underlying \texttt{ImageMagick} library.
It is recommended to install the Perl binding for \texttt{Image::Magick} from
the same source as the library was obtained, either from your system's repository,
or from the \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{ImageMagick} site, itself.
In the latter case, follow the instructions at \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{ImageMagick}
to download and install the latest version of ImageMagick being sure to enable
and build the Perl binding along with it.

\item[Graphics::Magick] is an \emph{alternative} to \texttt{Image::Magick} that \LaTeXML\ will
use if is found on the system; it may (or may not ) be easier to install, although it
is less widely available.

\item[UUID::Tiny] generates unique identifiers that can be used to make better ePub documents
  (it can be installed using \htmlref{CPAN}{get.cpan.prereq}).

\item[perl-doc]\label{get.perl-doc}
 On \emph{some} compact distributions the perl documentation modules
 are not installed by default (eg.~debian minimal). These modules help generate
 readable command-line documentation for the \LaTeXML\ tools. Thus you \emph{may}
 want to install an extra package (\texttt{perl-doc} on debian minimal) to enable this feature. 

\end{description}
\emph{Note to packagers:} If you are preparing a compiled installation package (such as rpm or deb) for
\LaTeXML, and the above packages are easily installable in your distribution,
you probably should include them as dependencies of \LaTeXML.

\subsection{Linux systems}\label{get.linux}
\subsubsection[RPM-based systems]{RPM-based systems}\label{get.linux.rpm}
\index{rpm}\index{Fedora}\index{Redhat}\index{Centos}
Current (or recent) releases of \LaTeXML\ should be available from
the Fedora (and probably others including Redhat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux\ldots)
repositories (Thanks Mike Petullo).

\paragraph*{Installing prebuilt}\\
The following command will install \LaTeXML, including its required
and optional prerequisites, including texlive for \TeX\
(use the appropriate command: \texttt{yum} or \texttt{dnf}, depending on system and version):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo yum install LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only} prerequisites}\label{get.linux.rpm.prereq}
The prerequisites (including the optional ones) can be installed
by running this command: 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo yum install \
  perl-Archive-Zip perl-DB_File perl-File-Which \
  perl-Getopt-Long perl-Image-Size perl-IO-String perl-JSON-XS \
  perl-libwww-perl perl-Parse-RecDescent perl-Pod-Parser \
  perl-Text-Unidecode perl-Test-Simple perl-Time-HiRes perl-URI \
  perl-XML-LibXML perl-XML-LibXSLT \
  perl-UUID-Tiny texlive ImageMagick ImageMagick-perl
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Debian-based systems}\label{get.linux.debian}\index{Debian}
For Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), the deb repositories
are generally used for software installation.
\LaTeXML\ is available from Debian's \emph{unstable} repositories
(the version in the stable repositories may be quite old)
(Thanks Peter Ralph and Atsuhito Kohda).

\paragraph*{Installing prebuilt}
The following command will install \LaTeXML, including its required
and optional prerequisites, including \TeX:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo apt-get install latexml
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only} prerequisites}\label{get.linux.debian.prereq}
The prerequisites (including optional ones) can be installed
by running this command: 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo apt-get install   \
  libarchive-zip-perl libfile-which-perl libimage-size-perl  \
  libio-string-perl libjson-xs-perl libtext-unidecode-perl \
  libparse-recdescent-perl liburi-perl libuuid-tiny-perl libwww-perl \
  libxml2 libxml-libxml-perl libxslt1.1 libxml-libxslt-perl  \
  texlive-latex-base imagemagick libimage-magick-perl
\end{lstlisting}
See note \ref{get.perl-doc} about optional installation of \texttt{perl-doc}.

\subsubsection{Archlinux \& friends}\label{get.linux.arch}\index{Arch}
For Archlinux and derivatives, it is most convenient to install from sources via \htmlref{CPANM}{get.cpanm}. 
Nonetheless, a package can be found in the \href{https://aur.archlinux.org/}{Archlinux User Repository}.
Furthermore, most dependencies can be found in the official repositories.

\paragraph*{Installing from AUR}
To install latexml from the user repositories, install the \href{https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-latexml/}{perl-latexml} package. 

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only} prerequisites}
To install the dependencies, use the following pacman command:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo pacman -S db imagemagick perl perl-algorithm-diff \
   perl-archive-zip perl-file-which perl-image-size \
   perl-io-string perl-libwww perl-json-xs \
   perl-parse-recdescent perl-xml-libxml perl-xml-libxslt \
   texlive-core
\end{lstlisting}
Additionally, install the \href{https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-text-unidecode/}{perl-text-unidecode}
AUR package. 

\subsection{MacOS}\label{get.macos}\index{Apple Macintosh}

\subsubsection{MacPorts}\label{get.macos.macports}
For Apple Macintosh systems, the  \MacPorts\
repository is perhaps the most convenient way to install \LaTeXML;
(Thanks devens, Mojca, Sean and Andrew Fernandes).
Download and install \MacPorts\ from that site.

Since some users prefer \MacTeX\ and don't want a duplicate (large) texlive installed; 
the \emph{default} \LaTeXML\ installation does \emph{not} include texlive
(but it installs \LaTeXML's own style files where \texttt{texlive} can find them).

\paragraph*{MacTeX}  When using \MacTeX\ (assumed already installed),
the following command will install \LaTeXML, along with its prerequisites:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo port install LaTeXML +mactex
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{TeXLive}
The large texlive is broken down into separate
packages in MacPorts.  If not using \MacTeX, you'll likely want to install at
least \texttt{texlive-latex}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo port install texlive-latex
sudo port install LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{No \TeX}
Without any \TeX\ installed, use the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo port install LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only} prerequisites}\label{get.macos.macports.prereq}
The prerequisites (including optional ones except \TeX) can be installed by running:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
sudo port install \
  p5-archive-zip p5-file-which p5-getopt-long p5-image-size \
  p5-io-string p5-json-xs p5-text-unidecode p5-libwww-perl \
  p5-parse-recdescent p5-time-hires p5-uri p5-xml-libxml \
  p5-xml-libxslt p5-perlmagick
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Windows}\label{get.windows}\index{windows}
As with MacOS, there is no single \TeX\ package that we can assume
you'll want to use, so we include no dependency in the following.
You'll probably want to preinstall a version of your choice;
\MikTeX\ is popular.

\subsubsection{Windows using Chocolatey}\label{get.windows.chocolatey}
\paragraph*{Installing prebuilt}
When using the \Chocolatey\ package manager,
the following command will install \LaTeXML\ as well as all
its prerequisites (including ImageMagick)
(Thanks Ronald Tse):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
choco install latexml
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Windows using Strawberry Perl}\label{get.windows.strawberry}
\href{http://strawberryperl.com}{Strawberry Perl},
comes with \emph{many} of our prerequisites pre-installed,
and provides other needed commands (\texttt{perl}, \texttt{cpan}, \texttt{dmake}).

\paragraph*{Installing prebuilt}\label{get.windows.strawberry}
There is currently no prebuilt \LaTeXML\ for Windows,
but it should install cleanly using the CPAN tool that comes with
\href{http://strawberryperl.com}{Strawberry Perl}.
Install the \TeX-system of your choice (if desired),
ImageMagick (see \ref{get.windows.imagemagick})
and then install LaTeXML using:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
cpan LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}

Installing the optional package \texttt{Image::Magick} on Windows seems to be problematic,
so we have omitted it from these instructions.
You may want to try \href{ImageMagick}, but
you're on your own, there!  You may  have better luck with \texttt{Graphics::Magick}.

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only} prerequisites  under Strawberry}\label{get.windows.strawberry.prereq}\\
Install \href{http://strawberryperl.com}{Strawberry Perl}, and
the \TeX-system of your choice (if desired), 
ImageMagick (if you want to try; see \ref{get.windows.imagemagick}),
and then install the additional prerequisites as
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
cpan Image::Size Parse::RecDescent UUID::Tiny
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing ImageMagick under Windows}\label{get.windows.imagemagick}
In principle, you should be able to install the binary from ImageMagick
and then install the Perl binding using CPAN; unfortunately, it seems that the
CPAN version seldom matches the binary or fails for other reasons.  What
should work the following:

Download and install the main ImageMagick binary appropriate for your Windows system
from \href{http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows}{ImageMagick}.
Then fetch the \texttt{PerlMagick} tarball \emph{with the same version} from
\href{http://imagemagick.com/download/perl/}{ImageMagick/perl}.
Use the following commands to compile and install the PerlMagick,
with X.XX being the version you downloaded:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
tar -zxvf PerlMagick-X.XX.tar.gz
cd PerlMagick-X.XX
perl Makefile.PL
dmake
dmake test
dmake install
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{CPAN installation}\label{get.cpan}
The following command will install \LaTeXML\ and its Perl prerequisites,
but you may need to pre-install \texttt{libxml2} and  \texttt{libxslt} (See \ref{get.prerequisites}).
Pre-install \TeX\ and any optional Perl modules, if desired.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
cpan LaTeXML
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing \emph{only}  prerequisites}\label{get.cpan.prereq}
The following command will install the Perl prerequisites (including optional)
for \LaTeXML, but you may need to pre-install \texttt{libxml2} and  \texttt{libxslt} (See \ref{get.prerequisites}).
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
cpan Archive::Zip DB_File File::Which Getopt::Long Image::Size \
  IO::String JSON::XS LWP MIME::Base64 Parse::RecDescent \
  Pod::Parser Text::Unidecode Test::More URI \
  XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT UUID::Tiny
\end{lstlisting}
You may still want to install \TeX\ and \texttt{Image::Magick}
using other means.

\subsection{CPANM Installation}\label{get.cpanm}
On certain linux machines, you may not want to install \LaTeXML\ (or its dependencies)
system-wide, or you may simply lack the required root rights to do so. 
In such a case, it is convenient to install the \emph{development} version and 
dependencies into the home directory using a tool called 
\href{ https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus}{cpanminus}.

\paragraph*{Bootstrapping cpanminus} Configuring and setting up \texttt{cpanminus} can be achieved using the following commands
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
    # Download and install cpanminus
    curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
    
    # Setup a directory in ~/perl5 to contain all perl dependencies
    ~/perl5/bin/cpanm --local-lib=~/perl5 local::lib && eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Installing} Afterwards installing \LaTeXML\ and dependencies can be achieved with the 
simple command:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
    cpanm git://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML.git
\end{lstlisting}
This automatically fetches the latest version from GitHub and installs 
missing dependencies. 

\subsection{Archived Releases:}\label{get.archive}
\AllReleases.

%============================================================
\section{Documentation}\label{docs}
If you're lucky, all that should be needed to convert
a \TeX\ file, \textit{mydoc}\texttt{.tex} to XML, and
then to HTML would be:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell]
   latexml --dest=%mydoc%.xml %mydoc%
   latexmlpost --dest=%somewhere/mydoc%.html %mydoc%.xml
\end{lstlisting}
This will carry out a default transformation into HTML5,
which represents mathematics using MathML.  Using an
extension of xhtml would generate XHTML including MathML.
Adding the option \verb|--format=html4| to the call to \verb|latexmlpost|
will generate HTML (version 4), using images to represent the math.

If you're not so lucky, or want to get fancy, well \ldots dig deeper:
\begin{description}
\item[\href{manual/}{LaTeXML Manual}] (\href{manual.pdf}{\PDFIcon}).
\item[\href{manual/commands/latexml.html}{\texttt{latexml}}]
    describes the \texttt{latexml} command.
\item[\href{manual/commands/latexmlpost.html}{\texttt{latexmlpost} command}]
