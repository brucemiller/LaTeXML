\title{\LaTeXML\ \emph{A \LaTeX\ to XML Converter}}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

%============================================================
The \emph{Current release} is \htmlref{\CurrentVersion}{get}.

In the process of developing the
\href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{Digital Library of Mathematical Functions},
we needed a means of transforming
the LaTeX sources of our material into XML which would be used
for further manipulations, rearrangements and construction of the web site.
In particular, a true `Digital Library' should focus on the \emph{semantics}
of the material, and so we should convert the mathematical material into both
content and presentation MathML.
At the time, we found no software suitable to our needs, so we began
development of LaTeXML in-house.  

In brief, \texttt{latexml} is a program, written in Perl, that attempts to
faithfully mimic \TeX's behaviour, but produces XML instead of dvi.
The document model of the target XML makes explicit the model implied
by \LaTeX.
The processing and model are both extensible; you can define
the mapping between \TeX\ constructs and the XML fragments to be created.
A postprocessor, \texttt{latexmlpost} converts this
XML into other formats such as HTML or XHTML, with options
to convert the math into MathML (currently only presentation) or images.

\emph{Caveats}
% This is still a \emph{preview release} of LaTeXML.
It isn't finished, there are gaps in the coverage,
particularly in missing implementations of the many useful \LaTeX\ packages.
But is beginning to stabilize and interested parties
are invited to try it out, give feedback and even to help out.


%============================================================
\section{Examples}\label{examples}
At the moment, the best example of \LaTeXML's output is 
the \href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/}{DLMF} itself
--- the preview  will soon contain several chapters.
It is perhaps not a fair example, in that there is much
special-purpose processing to generate cross-referencing and metadata that is not
part of LaTeXML by default. Nevertheless, it gives an indication of the
math conversion and other features possible.

\section{Get \LaTeXML}\label{get}
\paragraph{Current Release:}\label{download.current}
The current release is \textbf{\CurrentVersion}.
See also the \href{Changes}{Change Log}.


\LaTeXML\ itself is written in `pure' Perl, but requires \TeX,
and several perl modules, some of which depend on C libraries.
It should always be possible to install \LaTeXML\ on any platform
with a sufficiently recent \href{http://www.perl.org/}{Perl},
\ref{install.source}, using CPAN to install the prerequisites.

In most cases, however, it will be preferable to install
a platform-specific, pre-compiled, release, as this often
takes care of installing dependencies and updates,
and allows cleaner uninstall.  See  \ref{install.osnotes} for
platform-specific releases and instructions.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

The following additional Perl modules are required, but often will
be automatically installed by OS-specific procedures:
% %3A%3A for :: ???
\begin{description}
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Parse::RecDescent&mode=module}{Parse::RecDescent}]
    a useful grammar based parser module.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Image::Magick&mode=module}{Image::Magick}]
    provides bindings to the \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{ImageMagick} library.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXML&mode=module}{XML::LibXML}]
    provides bindings to the C library libxml2
    (available from \href{http://www.xmlsoft.org}{xmlsoft}).
    Versions before 1.61 will require the additional \texttt{XML::LibXML::XPathContext} module.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXSLT&mode=module}{XML::LibXSLT}]
    provides bindings to the C library libxslt
    (from \href{http://www.xmlsoft.org}{xmlsoft},
%  <li><tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::LibXML::XPathContext&mode=module">XML::LibXML::XPathContext</a></tt>
%      Depends on the XML::LibXML module.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DB_File&mode=module}{DB\_File}]
    usually part of a standard Perl installation, provided
    \href{http://www.sleepycat.com}{BerkeleyDB} is installed.
\item[\href{http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Simple&mode=module}{Test::Simple}]
    usually part of a standard Perl installation.
\end{description}

\subsection{From Source}\label{install.source}
\paragraph{Install Prerequisites}
Assuming that all the required C packages (for libxml2 and libxslt) are already installed on your system,
  use CPAN to install the required perl modules (typically as root):
\begin{alltt}
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   install Parse::RecDescent, XML::LibXML, XML::LibXSLT, DB_File
   quit
\end{alltt}
The \texttt{Image::Magick} module often installs best by enabling the
perl bindings as part of compiling and installing the main ImageMagick package.

\paragraph{Download} \CurrentTarball
\paragraph{Install} proceeds via the usual Perl module incantations:
\begin{alltt}
   tar zxvf LaTeXML-\CurrentVersion.tar.gz\\
   cd LaTeXML-\CurrentVersion\\
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
\end{alltt}
and then, as root:
\begin{alltt}
   make install
\end{alltt}
(See \texttt{perl perlmodinstall} for more details, if needed.)


\subsection[OS-Specific Notes]{Operating System Specific Notes}\label{install.osnotes}

\subsubsection[Fedora-based systems]{Fedora-based systems}\label{install.fedora}
For Fedora (and perhaps other similar) distributions, \texttt{yum} will automatically install
the needed prerequisites.
\paragraph{Download} \CurrentFedora
\paragraph{Install} using the command:
\begin{alltt}
   yum --nogpgcheck localinstall LaTeXML-\CurrentVersion-*.ltxml.noarch.rpm
\end{alltt}
If you had previously installed \LaTeXML\ rpm, you may want to explicitly
uninstall it \emph{first}, since the name has changed:
\begin{alltt}
   yum remove perl-LaTeXML
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection[Enterprise systems]{Enterprise-style RPM-based systems (RedHat, Centos)}\label{install.enterprise}
Although, \texttt{yum} will also install needed prerequisites, two of them are not available
on the more stable (\& conservative) distributions (such as RedHat Enterprise and CentOS).
\paragraph{Download Prerequisites} choose from the following according to your architecture:
\begin{description}
\item[32bit]
   \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07-1.c5.ltxml.i386.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext},
   \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXSLT-1.58-1.c5.ltxml.i386.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXSLT}
\item[64bit]
   \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07-1.c5.ltxml.x86_64.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext},
   \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXSLT-1.58-1.c5.ltxml.x86_64.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXSLT}
\item[Source RPM]
    \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07-1.c5.ltxml.src.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext},
    \href{releases/perl-XML-LibXSLT-1.58-1.c5.ltxml.src.rpm}{perl-XML-LibXSLT}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Download} \CurrentCentos
\paragraph{Install} using the command:
\begin{alltt}
   yum --nogpgcheck localinstall LaTeXML-\CurrentVersion-*.ltxml.noarch.rpm \textbackslash\\
       perl-XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07-1.*   \textbackslash\\
       perl-XML-LibXSLT-1.58-1.*
\end{alltt}

\subsubsection{Debian-based systems}\label{install.debian}
For Debian based distributions, presumably including Ubuntu,
all prerequisites are available from the standard repositories.
I do not currently have access to a Debian/Ubuntu system, so
have not created an appropriate \texttt{.deb} for \LaTeXML.
\paragraph{Install Prerequisites} using the command:
\begin{alltt}
   sudo apt-get install   \textbackslash\\
      libparse-recdescent-perl \textbackslash\\
      libxml2 libxml-libxml-perl \textbackslash\\
      libxslt1.1 libxml-libxslt-perl  \textbackslash\\
      imagemagick perlmagick
\end{alltt}
\paragraph{Install}
You can then continue by downloading and installing LaTeXML \ref{install.source}.

Some \href{http://rhaptos.org/devblog/reedstrm/latexml}{notes} on installation on Debian
based systems are also available.

\subsubsection{MacOS}\label{install.macos}
Many of the prerequisite packages are available via
\href{http://www.macports.org}{MacPorts}.
\paragraph{For the Adventurous}  As an easy alternative --- if it works ---
download \CurrentMacOS, save in it's own directory as \texttt{Portfile}
(without the version number) and, within that directory, run
\begin{alltt}
  sudo port install
\end{alltt}
This should install \LaTeXML\ and it's all dependencies;
Otherwise, continue as below.
\paragraph{Install Prerequisites} using the command:
\begin{alltt}
  sudo port install    \textbackslash\\
      p5-xml-libxml p5-xml-libxslt  \textbackslash\\
      p5-parse-recdescent p5-perlmagick
\end{alltt}
\paragraph{Install}
You can then continue by downloading and installing LaTeXML \ref{install.source}.

\emph{Note} there have been issues reported regarding \verb|DB_File|
not being installed;  Apparently you must install the 
the db `variant' of perl, rather than the gdbm variant
(whatever that means).

\subsubsection{Windows}\label{install.windows}
Many of the prerequisite packages are available in
ppm form (for \href{http://activestate.com/}{ActivePerl} (I think).
I will attempt to generate a ppm for LaTeXML in the near
future, depending on user interest --- and assistance!

\subsection{SVN Repository}\label{download.svn}
The most current code can be obtained from the svn repostory.
It is browsable at \url{https://svn.mathweb.org/repos/LaTeXML}.
Anonymous checkout is available using the command:
\begin{alltt}
  svn co https://svn.mathweb.org/repos/LaTeXML
\end{alltt}
After checkout, you can continue the installation
as described in \ref{install.source}.

\subsection{Licence}\label{license}

United States Government, it is not subject to copyright,
and is in the public domain.
Note that according to
\href{http://www.gnu.org/licences/license-list.html#PublicDomain}{Gnu.org}

%============================================================
\section{Documentation}\label{docs}
If you're lucky, all that should be needed to convert
a \TeX\ file, \textit{mydoc}\texttt{.tex} to XML, and
then to XHTML+MathML would be:
\begin{alltt}
   latexml --dest=\textit{mydoc}.xml \textit{mydoc}
   latexmlpost -dest=\textit{somewhere/mydoc}.xhtml \textit{mydoc}.xml
\end{alltt}
This will carry out a default transformation into XHTML+MathML.  If you
give the destination extension with html, it will generate HTML+images.

If you're not so lucky, or want to get fancy, well \ldots dig deeper:
