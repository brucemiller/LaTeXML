# Color objects; objects representing color in "arbitrary" color models

# and allow derived color models (with scaled ranges, or whatever; see xcolor).
# There is some awkwardness in that we'd like to support the core models
# directly with built-in code, but support derived models that possibly
# are defined in terms of macros defined as part of a style file.

# NOTE: This class is in Common since it could conceivably be useful
# in Postprocessing --- But the API, includes, etc haven't been tuned for that!

=head1 NAME

C<LaTeXML::Common::Color> - abstract class representating colors using various color models;
extends L<LaTeXML::Common::Object>.

=head2 Exported functions

=over 4

=item C<< $color = Color($model,@components); >>

Creates a Color object using the given color model, and with the given components.
The core color models are C<rgb>, C<hsv>, C<cmy>, C<cmyk> and C<gray>.
The components of colors using core color models are between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

=item C<< Black >>, C<< White >>

Constant color objects representing black and white, respectively.

=back

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item C<< $model = $color->model; >>

Return the name of the color model.

=item C<< @components = $color->components; >>

Return the components of the color.

=item C<< $other = $color->convert($tomodel); >>

Converts the color to another color model.

=item C<< $string = $color->toString; >>

Returns a printed representation of the color.

=item C<< $hex = $color->toHex; >>

Returns a string representing the color as RGB in hexadecimal (6 digits).

=item C<< $other = $color->toCore(); >>

Converts the color to one of the core colors.

=item C<< $complement = $color->complement(); >>

Returns the complement color (works for colors in C<rgb>, C<cmy> and C<gray> color models).

=item C<< $new = $color->mix($other,$fraction); >>

Returns a new color which results from mixing a C<$fraction> of C<$color>
with C<(1-$fraction)> of color C<$other>.

=item C<< $new = $color->add($other); >>

Returns a new color made by adding the components of the two colors.

=item C<< $new = $color->scale($m); >>

Returns a new color made by mulitiplying the components by C<$n>.

=item C<< $new = $color->multiply(@m); >>

Returns a new color made by mulitiplying the components by the corresponding component from C<@n>.
