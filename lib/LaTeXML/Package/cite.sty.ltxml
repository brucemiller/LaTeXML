# Ignore the resorting of citations
# "Compression" of citation lists doesn't make much sense in XML.
# Likewise, the options aren't much help.

# These macros _could_ be used in formatting the citations,
# but that seems something better left to whoever is formatting
# the XML at the end.
# An alternative would be to store various styling info,
# but I'll leave that off, for now.
