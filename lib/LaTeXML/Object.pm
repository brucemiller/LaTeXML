=head1 NAME

C<LaTeXML::Object> - abstract base class for most LaTeXML objects.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<LaTeXML::Object> serves as an abstract base class for all other objects (both the
data objects and control objects).  It provides for common methods for
stringification and comparison operations to simplify coding and
to beautify error reporting.

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item C<< $string = $object->stringify; >>

Returns a readable representation of C<$object>,
useful for debugging.

=item C<< $string = $object->toString; >>

Returns the string content of C<$object>;
most useful for extracting a clean, usable, Unicode string from
tokens or boxes that might representing a filename or such.
To the extent possible, this should provide a string
that can be used as XML content, or attribute values,
or for filenames or whatever. However, control sequences
defined as Constructors may leave TeX code in the value.

=item C<< $boole = $object->equals($other); >>

Returns whether $object and $other are equal.  Should perform
a deep comparision, but the default implementation just compares
for object identity.

=item C<< $boole = $object->isaToken; >>

Returns whether C<$object> is an L<LaTeXML::Token>.

=item C<< $boole = $object->isaBox; >>

Returns whether C<$object> is an L<LaTeXML::Box>.

=item C<< $boole = $object->isaDefinition; >>

Returns whether C<$object> is an L<LaTeXML::Definition>.

=item C<< $digested = $object->beDigested; >>

Does whatever is needed to digest the object, and
return the digested representation.  Tokens would be digested
into boxes; Some objects, such as numbers can just return themselves.

=item C<< $object->beAbsorbed($document); >>

Do whatever is needed to absorb the C<$object> into the C<$document>,
typically by invoking appropriate methods on the C<$document>.
