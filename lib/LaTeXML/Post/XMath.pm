# LaTeXML::XMath  Math Formatter for LaTeXML's Parsed Math.
#   LaTeXML's parallel math markup model is rather primitive;
# we just let the ltx:Math contain ltx:XMath and any other math representations.
# There isn't any intelligent selection or classification of them (yet?).
#
#   If XMath is going to be kept in the document either alone,
# or as the "primary" representation within a Parallel markup,
# then all we have to do is leave it alone --- it's fine where it is.
#
#   If it is NOT the primary representation, however, then we'll need
# to MOVE the XMath from where it is to whereever the primary representation
# wants it.  Since it has ID's within it that are already known to the document,
# it needs to move, rather than be copied.
#
# AND, since any formatters that would follow this one would want to translate
# the XMath (which is now gone), this math formatter MUST be the last one....
# OR... Does it?????
