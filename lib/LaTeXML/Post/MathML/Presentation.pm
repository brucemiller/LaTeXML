# Presentation MathML with Line breaking
# Not at all sure how this will integrate with Parallel markup...

# Any displayed formula is a candidate for line-breaking.
# If it is not already in a MathFork, and needs line-breaking,
# then we ought to wrap in a MathFork, so as to preserve the
# slightly "semantically meaningful" form.
# If we're mangling the document structure in this way,
# it needs to be done before the main scan-all-math's loop,
# since it moves the maths around.
# However, since we also have to check whether it NEEDS line breaking beforehand,
# we might as well linebreak & store that line-broken result alongside.
# [it will get stored WITHOUT an XMath expression, though, so we won't be asked to redo it]
# convertNode will be called later on the main fork (unbroken).
# Also, other subexpressions inside MathFork/MathBranch that were created by
# the usual means (bindings for eqnarray, or whatever) will still need to
# be converted (convertNode).
# And in fact they also should be line-broken -- we just don't know the width!!
