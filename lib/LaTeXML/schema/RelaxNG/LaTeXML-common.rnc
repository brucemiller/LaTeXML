# Basic element classes:

## All strictly inline elements.
Inline.class = notAllowed

## All `physical' block elements. 
## A physical block is typically displayed as a block, but
## may not constitute a complete logical unit.
Block.class = notAllowed

## Additional miscellaneous elements that can appear in
## both inline and block contexts.
Misc.class = notAllowed

## All logical block level elements.
## A logical block typically contains one or more physical block elements.
## For example, a common situation might be \elementref{p},\elementref{equation},\elementref{p},
## where the entire sequence comprises a single sentence.
Para.class = notAllowed

## All metadata elements, typically representing hidden data.
Meta.class = notAllowed

# ======================================================================
# Attribute types

## The type for attributes specifying a length.
## Should be a number followed by a length, typically px.
## NOTE: To be narrowed later.
Length.type = text

## The type for attributes specifying a color.
## NOTE: To be narrowed later.
Color.type = text

# ======================================================================
## Attributes shared by ALL elements.
Common.attributes =

#  ## provides for namespace declaration.
#  attribute xmlns { text }?,

  ## a space separated list of tokens, as in CSS.
  ## The \attr{class} can be used to add differentiate different instances of elements
  ## without introducing new element declarations.
  ## However, this generally shouldn't be used for deep semantic distinctions.
  ## This attribute is carried over to HTML and can be used for CSS selection.
  ## [Note that the default XSLT stylesheets for html and xhtml
  ## add the latexml element names to the class of html elements
  ## for more convenience in using CSS.]
  attribute class { xsd:NMTOKENS }?

## Attributes for elements that can be cross-referenced
## from inside or outside the document.
ID.attributes = 

  ## the unique identifier of the element, 
  ## usually generated automatically by the latexml.
  attribute xml:id { xsd:ID }?

## Attributes for elements that can cross-reference other elements.
IDREF.attributes =

  ## the identifier of the referred-to element.
  attribute idref { xsd:IDREF }?

## Attributes for elements that can be labelled from within LaTeX.
## These attributes deal with assigning a label and generating cross references.
Labelled.attributes =
  ID.attributes,

  ## Records the various labels that LaTeX uses for crossreferencing.
  ## (note that \cs{label} can associate more than one label with an object!)
  ## It consists of space separated labels for the element.
  ## The \cs{label} macro provides the label prefixed by \texttt{LABEL:};
  ## Spaces in a label are replaced by underscore.
  ## Other mechanisms (like acro?) might use other prefixes (but \texttt{ID:} is reserved!)
  attribute labels { text }?,

  ## the reference number (ie. section number, equation number, etc) of the object.
  attribute refnum { text }?,

  ## the formatted reference number of the object, typically this is the refnum with
  ## the object type prepended, such as "Chapter 2"
  attribute frefnum { text }?

## Attributes shared by low-level, generic inline and block elements
## that can be sized or shifted.
Positionable.attributes =

  ## the desired width of the box
  attribute width { Length.type }?,

  ## the desired height of the box
  attribute height { Length.type }?,

  ## the desired depth of the box
  attribute depth { Length.type }?,

  ## extra width beyond the boxes natural size.
  attribute pad-width { Length.type }?,

  ## extra height beyond the boxes natural size.
  attribute pad-height { Length.type }?,

  ## horizontal shift the position of the box.
  attribute xoffset { Length.type }?,

  ## vertical shift the position of the box.
  attribute yoffset { Length.type }?,

  ## alignment of material within the box.
  attribute align { "left" | "center" | "right" | "justified" }?,

  ## specifies which line of the box is aligned to the baseline of the containing object.
  attribute vattach { "top" | "middle" | "bottom" }?

## Attributes for elements that may be converted to image form
## during postprocessing, such as math, graphics, pictures, etc.
Imageable.attributes =

  ## the file, possibly generated from other data.
  attribute imagesrc { xsd:anyURI }?,

  ## the width in pixels of \attr{imagesrc}.
  attribute imagewidth { xsd:nonNegativeInteger}?,

  ## the height in pixels of \attr{imagesrc}.
  attribute imageheight { xsd:nonNegativeInteger }?,

  ## a description of the image
  attribute description { text }?
