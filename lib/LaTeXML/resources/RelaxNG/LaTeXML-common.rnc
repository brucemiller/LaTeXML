Block.class = notAllowed

## Additional miscellaneous elements that can appear in

Misc.class = notAllowed

## All logical block level elements.
## A logical block typically contains one or more physical block elements.

# Attribute types

## The type for attributes specifying a length.

## Attributes shared by ALL elements.
Common.attributes =

#  ## provides for namespace declaration.
#  attribute xmlns { text }?,

  ## a space separated list of tokens, as in CSS.
  ## The \attr{class} can be used to add differentiate different instances of elements
  ## without introducing new element declarations.
  ## However, this generally shouldn't be used for deep semantic distinctions.
  ## This attribute is carried over to HTML and can be used for CSS selection.
  ## [Note that the default XSLT stylesheets for html and xhtml
  ## add the latexml element names to the class of html elements
  ## for more convenience in using CSS.]

  RDF.attributes

## Attributes for elements that can be cross-referenced
## from inside or outside the document.
ID.attributes = 

  ## the unique identifier of the element, 
  ## usually generated automatically by the latexml.
  attribute xml:id { xsd:ID }?

## Attributes for elements that can cross-reference other elements.
IDREF.attributes =

  ## the identifier of the referred-to element.
  attribute idref { xsd:IDREF }?

## Attributes for elements that can be labelled from within LaTeX.
## These attributes deal with assigning a label  and generating cross references.
## The label migrates to an \attr{xml:id} and \attr{href} and the element
## can serve as a hypertext target.
Labelled.attributes =
  ID.attributes,

  ## Records the various labels that LaTeX uses for crossreferencing.
  ## (note that \cs{label} can associate more than one label with an object!)
  ## It consists of space separated labels for the element.
  ## The \cs{label} macro provides the label prefixed by \texttt{LABEL:};
  ## Spaces in a label are replaced by underscore.
  ## Other mechanisms (like acro?) might use other prefixes (but \texttt{ID:} is reserved!)
  attribute labels { text }?,

  ## the reference number (ie. section number, equation number, etc) of the object.
  attribute refnum { text }?,

  ## the formatted reference number of the object as it would appear when labelling the object,
  ## typically this is the refnum with the object type prepended, such as "Chapter 2".
  ## This is what eg, \cs{labelenumi} or \cs{fnum@table} would produce.  
  ## This attribute is only needed when different from \attr{refnum}.
  attribute frefnum { text }?,

  ## the referencing reference number of the object as it might appear
  ## when referencing the object, such as an equation number with parentheses.
  ## This is useful for generated references to clarify the type of object,
  ##  but is not used with LaTeX's usual \cs{ref}.
  ## And, note that \cs{eqnref} puts its own parentheses.
  ## This attribute is only needed when different from both \attr{frefnum} and  \attr{refnum}.
  attribute rrefnum { text }?

## Attributes for elements that can be referred to from within LaTeX.
## Such elements may serve as the starting point of a hypertext link.

  ## series (\texttt{medium}, \texttt{bold}, \ldots),
  ## and shape (\texttt{upright}, \texttt{italic}, \texttt{slanted}, \texttt{smallcaps}, \ldots).
  ## Only the values differing from the current context are given.
  ## Each component is open-ended, for extensibility; it is thus unclear
  ## whether unknown values specify family, series or shape.
  ## In postprocessing, these values are carried to the \attr{class} attribute,
  ## and can thus be effected by CSS.
  attribute font { text }?,

  ## Indicates the text size to use. The values are modeled after the
  ## more abstract \LaTeX\ font size switches, rather than point-sizes.
  ## The values are open-ended for extensibility;
  ## In postprocessing, these values are carried to the \attr{class} attribute,
  ## and can thus be effected by CSS.
  attribute fontsize { "Huge" | "huge" | "LARGE" | "Large" | "large" | "normal"

## Attributes for elements that draw something, text or otherwise, that can be colored.
Colorable.attributes =

  attribute opacity { xsd:float }?

## Attributes for elements that take up space and make sense to have a background color.
## This is independent of the colors of any things that it may draw.
Backgroundable.attributes =
  ## the color to use for the background of the element; any CSS compatible color specification.
  ## In postprocessing, these values are carried to the \attr{class} attribute,
  ## and can thus be effected by CSS; the background will presumably
  ## correspond to a bounding rectangle, but is determined by the CSS rendering engine.
  attribute backgroundcolor { text }?

## Attributes shared by low-level, generic inline and block elements
## that can be sized or shifted.
Positionable.attributes =

  ## the desired width of the box

  ## the color of the frame or outlie for the box.
  attribute framecolor { text }?

## Attributes shared by (hopefully few) elements that can be transformed.
## Such elements should also have Positionable.attributes.
## Transformation order of an individual element is assumed to be
## translate, scale, rotate; wrap elements to achieve different orders.
## Attributes \attr{innerwidth}, \attr{innerheight} and \attr{innerdepth} describe
## the size of the contents of the element before transformation;
## The result size would be encoded in Positional.attributes.
Transformable.attributes =
  ## horizontal shift the position of the inner element.

  attribute imageheight { xsd:nonNegativeInteger }?,

  ## the depth in pixels of \attr{imagesrc}, being the location of the
  ## baseline of the content shown in the image.
  ## When displayed inilne, an image with a positive \attr{depth}

  ## a description of the image
  attribute description { text }?

## Attributes for RDFa (Resource Description Framework),
## following RDFa Core 1.1 \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/}.
## The following descriptions give a short overview of the usage of the attributes,
## but see the specification for the complete details, which are sometimes complex.
RDF.attributes = 
  ## indicates the default vocabulary

  ## or \attr{typeof} on the same node, or by the text content of the node.
  attribute property { text }?,

  ## indicates the predicate exactly as \attr{property} except that it can
